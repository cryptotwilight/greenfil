This is the Green Fil Repository. The Green Fil Project has been created to provide an easy to use dashboard that will allow the Filecoin community to identify Green SPs along with their Geography. 
The aim of the project is to help to bring Green equity to the Fil network by highlighting areas of opportunity were Green Fil mining can take place. To illustrate a country may have copious 
under utilised renewable energy however very little in the way of Filecoin infrastructure. This presents a community opportunity for Green infrastructure expansion.
